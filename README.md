# MyReads Project

The MyReads App allows you to track the books you are reading, have read, and want to read.

## To get started developing:

* start the development server with `npm start`

###How to use the app:

* Books are separated into shelves.
* Switch books from one shelf to another using the drop down menu.
* Search books by clicking the '+' button and typing in your query.
